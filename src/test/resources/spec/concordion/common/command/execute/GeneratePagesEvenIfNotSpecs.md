# Be able to create pages in any valid format that aren't specs

## User Story

As a specification writer, I want to be free to create pages in my specification that aren't specs, in markdown, Excel or HTML/XHTML, so that I can structure supplementary information in any way that I think my readers would find most clear and organized, while at the same time being able to take advantage of the convenience and readability of markdown syntax or Excel spreadsheets over HTML.

## Example: Convert Markdown File

*Given* markdown file **RandomFile.md** in the spec directory that **does not have a matching Fixture**.

*When* Concordion runs.

*Then* RandomFile.md should be **converted to HTML file RandomFile.html**.
